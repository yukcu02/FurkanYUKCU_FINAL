# Swift Project - iTunes Search Application
This project is an iOS application that allows you to search and view details of music and other media content using the iTunes API. The application is developed using the Viper architecture and has a user-friendly interface.
Project Details
## iTunes API:
 In this project, the iTunes API is utilized to search for music and media content. You can find detailed documentation for the API here.
## Viper Architecture: 
The project follows the Viper architectural pattern, which separates the application's components into View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. This architecture promotes modularity, testability, and scalability.
## Main Screen: 
The main screen of the application features a search bar where users can enter search keywords. The search results are displayed in either a table view or a collection view, depending on the user's preference.
## Detail View:
Tapping on a specific item in the search results takes the user to the detail view, which provides more information about the selected item. Users have the option to add the item to their favorites.
## Favorites Management:
Users can add items to their favorites list from the detail view. They can also remove items from the favorites list, and a confirmation prompt is displayed to ensure user intent.
## Unit Testing and UI Testing: 
The project includes both unit tests and UI tests to ensure the stability and functionality of the application.
## Favorite Items with Core Data: 
The favorites functionality is implemented using Core Data, allowing users to save their favorite items persistently.
## Audio Playback: 
If audio data is available for a selected item, pressing the audio button triggers the playback of the audio. If audio data is not available, the button visually indicates as if it is playing.
# Getting Started
